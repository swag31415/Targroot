A webapp I made to assist Edgewood Target Team Members in the Electronics Department with their day-to-day activities.

## Features
- [ ] guests can type in what they need and get a map with directions of where it is and how many we have. Or it says we have some in the backroom (and maybe points to the nearest team member)
- [X] team members can scan all the items they need to push ~~and it will create an ideal route through the store~~
- [ ] It can tell you whether to box or spider wrap the item, if you scan all of them it tells you how many boxes/spider wrap you need (and what sizes)
- [ ] it will ask how many there are left and what the price is periodically to ensure the numbers are correct
- [ ] it can maybe notify team members if lots of guests are headed their way (privacy concern though)
- [ ] based on how much is usually on the shelf and at what point things were backstocked before it can say what needs to be backstocked
